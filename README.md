# ai-dev-team Platform (Frontend Design Mockup)

This project is a high-fidelity **frontend design mockup** created for the **ai-dev-team** application. It serves as a working prototype to demonstrate the user interface, interaction patterns, and multi-agent workflow of a high-performance development orchestration platform.

## 📋 Overview

ai-dev-team is a concept for an orchestration platform designed to automate the software engineering lifecycle. By utilizing a swarm of specialized autonomous agents, it transforms high-level product ideas into production-ready specifications, architectural blueprints, and functional codebases.

**Note:** This current repository is a frontend-only demonstration. It simulates backend processing and agent synthesis to showcase the intended user experience.

## 🚀 Core Features (Mockup Features)

- **Autonomous Agent Swarm Simulation**: Demonstrates a pipeline orchestrating PM, Architect, and Engineer agents.
- **Real-time Synthesis UX**: Visualizes progress tracking as "code" is built by the simulated swarm.
- **Interactive Previews**: A sandboxed preview panel showing how generated applications would appear.
- **Advanced Settings Interface**: A professional settings module featuring account management, vibe coding levels, and model selection UI.
- **Artifact Management UI**: Pre-designed views for versioned PRDs, detailed system architecture roadmaps, and source code.

## 🏗 Architecture Concept

The simulated platform follows a linear agentic workflow:

1.  **PM Agent**: Analyzes user prompts to generate a comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD).
2.  **Architect Agent**: Consumes the PRD to produce a technical execution plan and system design.
3.  **Engineer Agent**: Synthesizes the execution plan into high-quality TypeScript/React source code.

## 🛠 Tech Stack (Mockup)

- **React 19**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **Lucide Icons**
- **Vite**

## 🏁 Getting Started

As this is a static design mockup, it does not require a backend or API keys to run the demo.

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ai-dev-team/mockup.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
