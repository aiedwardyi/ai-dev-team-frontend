# AI Dev Team: Multi-Agent Swarm Orchestrator

A high-fidelity software engineering platform that leverages an autonomous AI agent swarm to automate the end-to-end development lifecycle—from conceptual ideation to deployment-ready codebases.

## 📋 Platform Architecture

The **AI Dev Team** ecosystem coordinates specialized agents through a deterministic orchestration pipeline. By segregating responsibilities between product strategy, technical architecture, and full-stack engineering, the platform minimizes hallucinations and maximizes structural integrity.

### The Swarm Pipeline
1.  **PM Agent (Requirements)**: Transforms raw user intent into structured **Product Requirements Documents (PRDs)**.
2.  **Planner Agent (Architecture)**: Decomposes PRDs into multi-phase **System Design Blueprints**.
3.  **Engineer Agent (Synthesis)**: Synthesizes technical blueprints into functional **TypeScript/React Codebases**.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. Dynamic Progress Tracking
*   **Stage-Specific Pulse**: Real-time progress bars (0-100%) for each individual agent task, providing granular visibility into the "thinking" process.
*   **Global Completion Overlay**: A unified view of the entire project lifecycle status.

### 2. Interactive Reasoning Engines
*   **Model Selection**: Switch between specialized reasoning engines (Gemini 3 Pro, Claude, GPT) with a high-fidelity selection UI.
*   **Vibe Coding Momentum**: Integrated telemetry tracking development "vibe" and momentum.

### 3. Resilience & Self-Healing
*   **Fault Logic Monitor**: A dedicated runtime terminal tracking agent reasoning and system logs.
*   **Proactive Recovery**: Built-in "Agentic Self-Healing" protocols that diagnose, patch, and verify runtime errors.
*   **Simulation Tools**: Inject manual faults to test the swarm's recovery and patching capabilities.

### 4. Enterprise Artifact Management
*   **Live Preview Window**: Real-time rendering of generated code with Desktop and Mobile viewport toggles.
*   **Code Explorer**: Advanced file-tree navigation with custom syntax highlighting.
*   **Artifact Synchronization**: Seamless switching between PRDs, Execution Plans, and Source Code.

## 🛠 Technical Stack

*   **Frontend**: React 19 (Functional Components, Context API, Advanced Hooks)
*   **Design System**: Tailwind CSS (JIT, Custom Glassmorphism, Neon Utilities)
*   **Icons**: Lucide React
*   **Orchestration**: Custom `MockBackend` state machine for synchronized agent collaboration.

## 💻 Getting Started

This platform operates as a high-fidelity frontend simulation, requiring zero external API keys to demonstrate the full agentic workflow.

1.  **Initialize**: Run `npm install` to load core dependencies.
2.  **Launch**: Execute `npm run dev` to start the local simulation.
3.  **Synthesize**: Input a project brief on the dashboard to trigger the autonomous agent pipeline.
